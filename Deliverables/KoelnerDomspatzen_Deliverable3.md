## Update to Deliverable 2

### Class Diagram
#### Actors  

(From Requirements Document)  

- **Racer** – signs up, purchases license, registers for races, leaves reviews.  
- **Organizer** – creates races, manages stages, sets limits, enters results.  
- **Administrator** – manages accounts, licenses, and overall system settings.  
---

#### Core Classes  
(Domain-focused, directly from requirements)  

- **User** (abstract base class for Racer, Organizer, Administrator)  
- **Racer**  
- **Organizer**  
- **Administrator**  
- **Race**  
- **License**  
- **Registration** (represents a Racer registering for a Race)  
- **Result** (captures race outcomes and podium information)  
- **Review** (Racer feedback about a Race)  

---

#### Supporting System Classes  
(Implied, not explicitly in requirements but needed for real-world system design)  

- **AccountManager** (handles authentication and account lifecycle)  
- **PaymentProcessor** (handles credit card transactions for licenses)  
- **NotificationService** (notifies Racers of category upgrades or race information)  
- **DataRepository** (central persistence gateway for races, results, and users)  
- **UIController** (manages interaction between system logic and user interface)

### Design Principles  

We plan to apply the following design principles to guide the development of the bike racing registration system.  

*(Note: Not being stated below does not mean we will avoid other common strategies or principles; these are simply the primary ones we are highlighting for Deliverable 1.)*  

   #### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)  
  Each class will have a single, clear purpose.  
  **Example:** The `License` class will only manage license attributes (ID, category, expiration) rather than race registration or payment details.  

   #### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)  
  The system should be open for extension but closed for modification.  
  **Example:** The `Race` class should support new race types (road, gravel, time trial, etc...) without requiring changes to its core design, allowing future extensions through subclasses or composition.  

   #### Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY)  
  Shared logic will be centralized to prevent duplication.  
  **Example:** Login and account management will be handled in the base `User` class, avoiding repeated code in `Racer`, `Organizer`, and `Administrator`.  

   #### Keep It Simple (KISS)  
  The design will prioritize simplicity and avoid unnecessary complexity.  
  **Example:** Category upgrades will follow a direct rule (*five podium finishes = one category promotion*) rather than adding complicated point systems *(as stated in the requirements documentation).*  

### Design Constraints  

We have identified our constraints from two perspectives: **user/problem-side** and **technical/stack-side**.  

#### User / Problem-Side Constraints  

- **Licensing Requirement** *(Requirements Document, p.1)*  
  Racers must purchase a valid license to register for official races.  
  Licenses are valid for one year and tied to the racer’s current category.  

- **Category System** *(Requirements Document, p.1–2)*  
  Racers are sorted into categories 5–1 (5 = beginner, 1 = elite).  
  Racers must only compete in races that match their current category.  
  Racers are promoted one category after five podium finishes (1st, 2nd, 3rd).  

- **Race Setup Rules** *(Requirements Document, p.2)*  
  Every race must offer all categories (5–1).  
  Each race has a date, type, distance, route, registration deadline, and participant cap.  
  Official races count toward category upgrades; unofficial races do not.  

- **Race History Persistence** *(Requirements Document, p.2)*  
  The system must keep a permanent record of races, results, and reviews.  
  Racer history must remain consistent across sessions (no data loss).

- **System Security and Reliability**
  Although system security is not explicitly a listed as a requirement, our system stores user information and processes license purchases, thus necessitating the protection of system and user records.
  Likewise admin's will have the ability to edit user accounts and system settings. It's imperative that we keep these privledges gaurded from user's not explicitly designated as admins.
  For these reasons, users must be required provide a validated username and password before interacting with the system.
---

#### Technical / Stack-Side Constraints  

- **Programming Language: Java** *(Project Document, p.3 Deliverable 3/4)*  
  All implementation will be done in Java using object-oriented design.  


- **Deliverable Guidelines** *(Project Document, p.3–4)*  
  Early deliverables require UML diagrams and use case diagrams.  
  Future deliverables include architecture design, activity diagram, and UI sketches.  
  The final deliverable requires a functional system but does not require a full graphical user interface.  


- **Scalability & Extensibility** *(Project Document, learning objectives)*  
  The system should support design principles like SRP and OCP to allow new race types without redesign.  
  Each deliverable (1–4) expects maintaining and updating previous work.  


- **Data Management** *(Requirements Document, p.2)*  
  The system must persist race history, racer accounts, licenses, and results.  
  Persistence ensures that category upgrades and reviews are accurate over time.  

## Architectural Design
The Architectural design chosen is 'Layered'. We feel that this will be suffice for the size and depth of this project.
![Architecture Diagram](https://github.com/SLee-842/SER315/blob/main/resources/images/architecture-breakdown.png)
|:--:|
| **Figure 3.** Layered Architecture for Bike Racing Registration System |


## Presentation Layer (<span style="color:red">CLOSED</span>)
**Nodes:** Racer, Organizer, Administrator (actors) and UIController  

**Responsibility:** Provides the user interface for all actors to interact with the system. Captures input such as race registration, entering results, and managing licenses, then forwards requests to the Business Layer.  

**Closed because:** It only communicates with the Business Layer. Preventing direct access to Services or Persistence ensures all interactions follow defined workflows.  

---

## Business Layer (<span style="color:red">CLOSED</span>)
**Nodes:** Race, Registration, License, Result, Review, UpgradePolicy  

**Responsibility:** Encapsulates the core domain logic including race management, registration validation, license checks, result recording, category upgrades, and reviews. Ensures rules such as racers must hold a valid license or five podium finishes equal a promotion.  

**Closed because:** All business rules must be executed here before calling Services or Persistence. This enforces Single Responsibility and avoids bypassing business validation.  

---

## Services Layer (<span style="color:green">OPEN</span>)
**Nodes:** AccountManager, NotificationService, PaymentProcessor  

**Responsibility:** Provides reusable shared services across the system. Handles authentication, notifications such as upgrade emails, and payments for licenses.  

**Open because:** Multiple layers may need to use services directly. For example, the Business Layer calls PaymentProcessor for registrations, while Presentation could directly access NotificationService in future extensions. Marking this layer open supports extensibility without requiring deep changes to other layers which aligns with OCP.  

---

## Persistence Layer (<span style="color:red">CLOSED</span>)
**Node:** DataRepository  

**Responsibility:** Manages all data persistence operations by translating business objects into queries and ensuring reliable storage and retrieval. Provides a single entry point to the database, keeping storage logic consistent.  

**Closed because:** Only the Business Layer and Services Layer can call into it. Presentation cannot access the database directly. This avoids data corruption and enforces encapsulation.  

---

## Database Layer (<span style="color:red">CLOSED</span>)
**Node:** Database (Users, Races, Licenses, Results, Reviews)  

**Responsibility:** Physical storage of all system entities. Ensures long-term persistence of race history, licenses, results, and reviews.  

**Closed because:** It is strictly internal and only the Persistence Layer can access it. Direct access from upper layers would break data integrity and bypass validation.  

## Activity Diagram

## Enhancements on UI Sketches  

### Login / Signup View
The Login / Signup View provides a simple interface for users to access the Bike Racing Registration System. Figure 5 shows the Login / Signup View, where a user can either enter existing credentials to log in or create a new account through the signup option. Once authenticated, the system verifies their role (Racer, Organizer, or Administrator) and grants access to the appropriate functionality.

### Owner View
The Owner (Organizer) is responsible for recording race results. Figure 3 shows the **Owner View**, where the organizer selects a race, enters a racer’s ID, and records their podium position. Once submitted, the system stores the results and determines whether the race is official. If it is, the upgrade policy service is triggered automatically.

| **Figure 6.** Organizer inputting race information and results.|
---

### Racer View
The Racer interacts with the system primarily by registering for races and receiving updates. Figure 4 shows the **Racer View**, where the racer receives a notification that their category has been upgraded after achieving five podium finishes in official races. This notification ensures racers are aware of their current category standing and any changes made by the upgrade policy.

## Design Patterns Chosen  

### 1. Abstract Factory Pattern  

**Implementation:**  
_Fill Me Out_  

**Optional Illustration Table:**  
| Factory | Product Example | Notes |  
|---------|----------------|-------|  
| Fill Me Out | Fill Me Out | Fill Me Out |  

---

### 2. Singleton Pattern  

**Implementation:**  
- Applied to `RaceRepository` to enforce a single access point for persistent storage of racers, races, registrations, and results.  
- Ensures all parts of the system (Racer, Organizer, Administrator) interact with the same repository instance.  
- Prevents data inconsistency that could arise if multiple repository objects existed.  
- Simplifies synchronization since any update made through one reference is immediately visible system-wide.  

**Optional Illustration Table:**  

| Singleton        | Responsibility                                     | Benefit                                                                 |  
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| `RaceRepository` | Centralized data access for racers, races, results | Guarantees integrity, avoids conflicting writes, and ensures consistency |
