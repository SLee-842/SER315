### Class Diagram
#### Actors  

(From Requirements Document)  

- **Racer** – signs up, purchases license, registers for races, leaves reviews.  
- **Organizer** – creates races, manages stages, sets limits, enters results.  
- **Administrator** – manages accounts, licenses, and overall system settings.  

---

#### Core Classes  
(Domain-focused, directly from requirements)  

- **User** (abstract base class for Racer, Organizer, Administrator)  
- **Racer**  
- **Organizer**  
- **Administrator**  
- **Race**  
- **License**  
- **Registration** (represents a Racer registering for a Race)  
- **Result** (captures race outcomes and podium information)  
- **Review** (Racer feedback about a Race)  

---

#### Supporting System Classes  
(Implied, not explicitly in requirements but needed for real-world system design)  

- **AccountManager** (handles authentication and account lifecycle)  
- **PaymentProcessor** (handles credit card transactions for licenses)  
- **NotificationService** (notifies Racers of category upgrades or race information)  
- **DataRepository** (central persistence gateway for races, results, and users)  
- **UIController** (manages interaction between system logic and user interface)

### Design Principles  

We plan to apply the following design principles to guide the development of the bike racing registration system.  

*(Note: Not being stated below does not mean we will avoid other common strategies or principles; these are simply the primary ones we are highlighting for Deliverable 1.)*  

   #### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)  
  Each class will have a single, clear purpose.  
  **Example:** The `License` class will only manage license attributes (ID, category, expiration) rather than race registration or payment details.  

   #### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)  
  The system should be open for extension but closed for modification.  
  **Example:** The `Race` class should support new race types (road, gravel, time trial, etc...) without requiring changes to its core design, allowing future extensions through subclasses or composition.  

   #### Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY)  
  Shared logic will be centralized to prevent duplication.  
  **Example:** Login and account management will be handled in the base `User` class, avoiding repeated code in `Racer`, `Organizer`, and `Administrator`.  

   #### Keep It Simple (KISS)  
  The design will prioritize simplicity and avoid unnecessary complexity.  
  **Example:** Category upgrades will follow a direct rule (*five podium finishes = one category promotion*) rather than adding complicated point systems *(as stated in the requirements documentation).*  

### Design Constraints  

We have identified our constraints from two perspectives: **user/problem-side** and **technical/stack-side**.  

#### User / Problem-Side Constraints  

- **Licensing Requirement** *(Requirements Document, p.1)*  
  Racers must purchase a valid license to register for official races.  
  Licenses are valid for one year and tied to the racer’s current category.  

- **Category System** *(Requirements Document, p.1–2)*  
  Racers are sorted into categories 5–1 (5 = beginner, 1 = elite).  
  Racers must only compete in races that match their current category.  
  Racers are promoted one category after five podium finishes (1st, 2nd, 3rd).  

- **Race Setup Rules** *(Requirements Document, p.2)*  
  Every race must offer all categories (5–1).  
  Each race has a date, type, distance, route, registration deadline, and participant cap.  
  Official races count toward category upgrades; unofficial races do not.  

- **Race History Persistence** *(Requirements Document, p.2)*  
  The system must keep a permanent record of races, results, and reviews.  
  Racer history must remain consistent across sessions (no data loss).  

---

#### Technical / Stack-Side Constraints  

- **Programming Language: Java** *(Project Document, p.3 Deliverable 3/4)*  
  All implementation will be done in Java using object-oriented design.  


- **Deliverable Guidelines** *(Project Document, p.3–4)*  
  Early deliverables require UML diagrams and use case diagrams.  
  Future deliverables include architecture design, activity diagram, and UI sketches.  
  The final deliverable requires a functional system but does not require a full graphical user interface.  


- **Scalability & Extensibility** *(Project Document, learning objectives)*  
  The system should support design principles like SRP and OCP to allow new race types without redesign.  
  Each deliverable (1–4) expects maintaining and updating previous work.  


- **Data Management** *(Requirements Document, p.2)*  
  The system must persist race history, racer accounts, licenses, and results.  
  Persistence ensures that category upgrades and reviews are accurate over time.

## Review Section

**Instructor Feedback** 
- The instructor would like to be updated on our progress streamlining our collaboration tools (i.e. GitHub)
- Including contributions and reflections in the individual feedback section was a positive choice
- GitHub while primarily used for coding, was a good choice for team collaboration
- Good choice in design principles
- The Design Constraints section should be more focused on security, reliability etc.
- Our document was not in the order specified by the Project document
- Our Class diagram is hard to read, recommends cleaning it up and avoiding crossing lines
- Our Class diagram included a class without any relation
- Notes declairing AI usage was good
- Our Use Case diagram is overly detailed for a high level diagram, recommends simplifying
- Would like more details on the changes made to the AI generated diagrams

**Peer Feedback** 
- Expanding upon OCP and DRY principles would be benificial, specifically adding examples of how they could be applied
- Make relationships between supporting classes more explicit
- Diagram images are too small and hard to read
- Strong foundation

**Changes Made**
- Reorganized Deliverable 1 sectioon to better allign with the Project Document
